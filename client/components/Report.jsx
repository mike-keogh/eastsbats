       <h3>4th Grade The Bats team season report 2016-2017 by Rhys Stannard.</h3>

        Well although the weather never turned up to the party the Bats certainly did in a big way. In the sodden exchanges that surprisingly weren't cancelled we brought the Bulldogs to heel, slayed the Sri Lankans, trumped the Aces, ground the Axemen, castrated the Hawks, backstabbed the Bandits, sent the Indian Seniors to the Indian Senior Retirement Home and got thoroughly destroyed by the Chinamen. We saw our share of centurions and 5-fers, innumerable screaming catches and the odd unprovoked beamer. We clashed against friend and foe but never with each other and we all had a good deal of fun every game.

        Hats off to Isaiah Wilson for steaming in every Saturday, taking 39 wickets in spite of the protests of his dodgy knee and the pleas and sobs of the batter on strike. Hats off also to Felix Faisandier who joined our team this year and unleashed the most outstanding batting I have ever witnessed on the field in my life. Thank god he paid those subs. Hats off also to Mike Keogh most improved player this season. In his first season as a batter we sent him in as an opener and he stood up to score 360 runs at an average of 25.71 often providing a solid opening partnership alongside the smooth manuka man Nick Honey.

        Hats off also to Gabriel and Jack for tirelessly trudging in with their lethal dibbly-dobblies, that corridor never looked less certain. And to Jason Foote and Paul Mathews who often came together in the field to provide a run-out, or to surreptitiously play a match winning innings without raising a sweat. And of course Sloane was there too, laughing and joking, frosted lips gathered together in an angelic halo.

        Next season weâ€™ll be looking to retrieve all our hats and we hope the sun comes to the party!!
